# randomcronn-daemon
Project for Operating Systems for my university coursework. Define a testfile (see an example in backup/testfile) and follow the instructions below!

To see outputs generated by the randomcronn daemon, run:
```console
cat outfile
```

## How to test it?
Keep in mind that I've pasted absolute paths on my system in the makefile - they might differ on your system so certain tests might not work as intended

refer to the makefile to see the commands and tests
```console
make
```

```console
make test1
```

```console
make test2
```
etc... there are 4 tests in total.

in order to just run the randomcronn with your specified taskfile and outfile, run this command

```console
./randomcronn /home/ern/randomcronn-daemon/taskfile /home/ern/randomcronn-daemon/outfile
```

In order to see the daemon on the process tree, run
```console
pstree
```

## After you are done
```console
make clean
```
